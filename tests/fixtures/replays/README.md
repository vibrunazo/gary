# Replay fixtures

A small, committed set of replays for tests and for cloud/CI sessions that don't have the full
datasets. Bulk data lives in `data/` and is never committed.

## Rules for adding a fixture

- **Redistributable sources only.** STARDATA (BSD, with attribution), replays of games we play
  ourselves (e.g. vs. the computer or bot vs. bot), or packs whose license explicitly allows it.
  Nothing from sources marked `redistributable: unknown` or `no` in `data/sources.yaml`.
- **No ladder replays** from other players (account names, in-game chat).
- **Keep it small:** a handful of files, each well under 1 MB.
- **List every fixture below** with its source, license and why it's here.
- **Fixtures keep their source's license.** They are not covered by the repo's CC0/MIT-0 terms. STARDATA fixtures are BSD-licensed; keep the attribution.
