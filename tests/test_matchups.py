"""Every matchup Gary can play, a short headless game each (eval/match.py) on a ladder map: both sides' Garys
build (their manifests, the models of their matchup and race), play 3 minutes, and make workers. A matchup
whose Gary can't be built is skipped with the reason (no executor for a race yet, a model kind missing for
the matchup), so the table printed is what plays (docs/REFACTOR.md "Tests across matchups"). Needs the game
data and the ladder maps (skips without them); a minute or two.

Run: python -m pytest tests/test_matchups.py   (or plain: python tests/test_matchups.py)
