# TODO: open work

Open work is tracked in the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues); this file is their index,
grouped by area, newest thinking first (reconciled with the code on 2026-10-25). When an item is done its issue is
closed and its line leaves this file; docs/PROGRESS.md keeps what was done and how it measured.

## Learning (the self-play program, docs/SELF_PLAY.md)

- [#47](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/47) Pipe checks: do the learned layers' decisions reach the game, and do
  their inputs in play match their training data? (placement fixed, widespot; the macro's enemy history and the
  bunkered units, seenall and armyseen; tests/test_inputs.py checks the inputs now; the decisions so far as the replays
  count them in every build, 2026-10-31; left: the fight roles' extras, #52)
- [#50](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/50) Play and the replays count units differently: workers in gas buildings,
  turrets, the in-building queue's units, undetected cloaked units (the dataset's)
- [#28](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/28) Commit decision: a learning signal from locked paired branches
  (the signal weak: scored by the critic too, nothing beats the deployed model's preference in 941 pairs; next, pairs
  again on gt0.14dev's fixed inputs, several dice per arm, or a decision with longer consequences)
- [#51](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/51) Gary-Z's builds and burrows: the lurkers fixed (they never came up again);
  its builds held production (fixed, gz0.9dev); left: 99-233 burrows still refused a game, the late game of a
  losing Zerg (builds without drones)
- [#48](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/48) The Zerg's macro model counts the units in its eggs twice; the fix
  (option eggs) lost 96 paired games: no rule leans on it; the right counts move the model off zerglings to
  Hydralisks and it slows (its counts a momentum cue): eggs with the macro trained on Gary-Z's own states next
- [#52](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/52) The role models' inputs: Gary-Z's enemy HP fixed (gz0.5dev), the Terran's
  extras 3-5 in a rebuilt dataset and model (runs/roles/20261026-090057, not deployed: the next roles run's start)
- [#53](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/53) No fight-scenario reward ranks the roles checkpoints as games do: a reward
  that counts what fighting costs the rest of the game, or 96 games
- [#54](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/54) Build styles by name for each side, every game labelled (done: every
  matchup's catalogue, each race's model trained with them, the style check in every matchup, one Zerg macro model for
  every matchup in gz1dev, gz0.11dev, and gt1dev, gt0.24dev, the Protoss's in gp0.4); left: why Gary-Z's own states draw
  more lurkers and scourge from the shared model, and the citadel-first plans played as robotics (PvP 19%, PvT 50%)
- [#57](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/57) Gary-Z banks the gas it mines (920 at 10-15 minutes, pros 499)
- [#58](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/58) Gary-Z's builds per style: style 2 played as itself 31%, the third Hatchery
- [#59](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/59) Fold the dev manifests' execution fixes (parkmany, gaswaits, the gas head)
  into gt1, gt1dev and gz1
- [#55](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/55) The opening economy: new workers sent at once, the first worker first,
  workers on gas the macro model's decision (gastarget, gt0.20dev: style 2's natural 3.6 minutes, pros 3.2; the Zerg's,
  gz0.7dev); left: about 100 minerals mined behind the pros by 2:00 (the split, doubled fields, idle builders; Gary-Z's
  first Overlord at 58 s, pros 53)
- [#29](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/29) Why army dataset v5's commit models trail the deployed one in games
  (not the bunker counts: with armyseen v5 still trails, -0.039 over 96)
- [#3](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/3) Close out won games (the hunt imitated: its labels on the deployed
  commit model next)
- [#11](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/11) Learn from game outcomes
- [#12](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/12) Macro model with game history (a sequence over recent events)
- [#39](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/39) Anticipation: target inference for enemy groups
- [#40](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/40) Opponent model: a belief over the enemy's plan
- [#42](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/42) The army model's fight estimate from Gary's own fights
- [#45](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/45) The macro answers what the scout sees, without the scripted answers
- [#35](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/35) TvT Gary-T: its own fight model (done, gt0.23dev: the TvT role model),
  belief, plan and engage models
- [#34](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/34) More modern replays

## Gameplay

- [#2](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/2) Hold early zergling harass and all-ins (and how much to commit to defense)
- [#4](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/4) Micro: spreading, sieging, spells as learned decisions (Psionic Storm
  learned, gp0.11dev: gary/policy/cast.py's spell table takes the others' area spells next)
- [#26](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/26) Strategy layer: pick among proven builds and follow the timeline
  (and rebuild the selector's table from league games)
- [#37](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/37) Human game 4's failure list
- [#43](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/43) Scattered fighters back into the main group
- [#38](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/38) Map mechanics on the current ladder maps: neutral units and per-map priors
- [#16](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/16) Learn building placement and scouting from replays (a building's base
  and side learned for the Protoss, gp0.21dev; Corsairs scouting as the army's air clusters, PvZ, gp0.23dev; saving for the first
  Corsair, gp0.24dev, its Core, gp0.25dev, and its natural Nexus, gp0.26dev; next the tile, the other races, the other matchups' air clusters, the macro's look a moment after each decision)
- [#25](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/25) Walls: copy the pros' walls per map and start location
- [#23](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/23) Map analysis: split maps at their chokes
- [#36](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/36) Protoss: the executor (refactor Phase 4) begun, `gp1` plays every matchup
  with its role model and styles, plays its styles as the pros do (PV161a, PZ161a); next the dev builds' fights in PvT and
  PvZ by their matchups' role models (gt0.21dev, gz0.10dev), every mirror by its own (gt0.23dev, gz0.11dev, gp0.2),
  the Protoss's PvT and PvZ apart (gp0.3), its dev build (gp1dev, docs/RACES.md), the Terran's queue of two (gp0.5dev),
  Reavers and Carriers armed (gp0.8dev: they never fired before), Archons merged as the pros do (gp0.9dev), the pros' key
  layout (gp0.10dev), storms (gp0.11dev), Pylons placed for room (gp0.12dev: its Gateways had no spot), refused buildings
  taken back (gp0.13dev), a decided building among its own until it starts (gp0.14dev: the second Stargate 1.5 to 1.2),
  buildings placed by the pros' table (gp0.15dev: the natural's wall, cannons at every base; Probes lost to raids 9.9 to 3.6),
  cannons by the mineral line and at every base in each game (gp0.16dev: Probes lost to raids 0.75 a game, the pros 0.9);
  idle Probes sent back at once (gp0.17dev: idle at the main 0.46 at a time to 0.22, the pros 0.13), the openings'
  buildings by the pros' shares per style and every matchup's tables (gp0.18dev), the gateway-first Gateway on time
  (gp0.19dev), Probes pulled against raids (gp0.20dev: lost to raids 3.48 a game to 2.31, the pros 0.90); left: the
  commit model's answer to raids at home, Mutalisk raids with no cannon by the Nexus (32%, the pros 6%), shuttles, cannons at newer bases, unit mix
  (cannons PvZ 24.5 at 20:00, the pros 13.8; High Templar two thirds of the pros')
- [#61](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/61) The Terran's modes in PvT (gt0.22dev siege and lay mines): held as long as the
  pros hold them, the pros' mines outside fights, Spider Mines four minutes late
- [#62](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/62) Type gg and leave when the critic's win odds stay under 20% (default;
  an option plays on; dev builds play to the end and record their would-gg moments); a critic per matchup and its
  calibration done (eval/critic_gg.py: won after a would-gg in 0-12% of decided games at 20%, 0-5% at 10%); left the
  pros' odds when they leave, then the rule
- Later, as supervised skills: [#21](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/21) worker drilling,
  [#22](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/22) bunker rush

## Evaluation and tools

- [#31](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/31) Mirror health rounds and the Protoss macro models (rounds played, no errors;
  left: the death records' slot in mirrors; the Protoss PvT/PvZ misses are Zealot/Dragoon and reactive buildings)
- [#64](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/64) The army layer's draws use seed 0 in every game (fix with the next version
  bump of every build: every baseline replayed)
- [#63](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/63) Grade games at time by the critic's win odds, not the supply ratio
  (regrade past rounds both ways first: adopt only if the minimum detectable effect shrinks)
- [#32](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/32) The gap score disagrees with results
- [#44](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/44) Engine error at the map's edge
- [#15](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/15) Fit human-interface profiles from replays
- [#41](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/41) Explainability: a narrator over the decision records
- [#17](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/17) Viewer: the action overlay in the interactive window
- When full-game self-play needs the speed: [#19](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/19) vectorized env,
  [#20](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/20) a C++ per-frame core

## The Remastered bridge

- [#24](https://github.com/vibrunazo/gary/issues/24) Adapt to the layer refactor (`ScrGame.terrain`, `type_select`; a live
  game of the current gt1; a unit's `ammo` and `ammo_max`, which Gary-P's hands read)
