"""Training data for Gary's army model: where a player sends their army, and how.

From every clean, re-simulated game, each player's orders to army units (at least 4 supply
selected; at most one per 2 s, the last) become samples of:

  grid    (9, 16, 16)  the map as that player knew it, on a 16x16 grid (values capped at 255):
                       0-2 own army supply x2 / workers / buildings,
                       3-5 the same for enemy units visible right now,
                       6 enemy buildings ever seen (most at once), 7 enemy army seen in the last 30 s,
                       8 the ordered group (its supply x2, in its cell)
  units   (228,)       own units by type (all), seen (228,) enemy units visible now
  eco     (4,)         minerals, gas, supply used x2, supply max x2;  frame
  target  cell 0-255 where the group was sent;  kind 0 move, 1 attack (attack-move or a target)
  sup     supply x2 of the ordered group

Coordinates are mirrored so the player's own main is always in the top-left quadrant (maps and
start positions differ; the model learns "toward the enemy", not "toward the top-right").
Far moves (attacks, retreats, defending) and short ones (holding, fighting in place) are both
kept, so the model also learns when the army stays where it is.

Commitments (v2): orders alone say where a pro sends a group, not when they leave it be. So every
TICK seconds each of the player's army clusters (Gary's clustering: the densest cell of their army
and the cells within 2, up to 3 clusters, at least MIN_SUP; from v6 the ground army's and its flyers'
apart) is a sample too, labeled by what the
player did with it in the next TICK seconds: keep (no order sending a group there 2+ cells: shorter
orders are fighting or standing in place), engage (an order sending it 2+ cells to a cell next to
enemy presence the player knew of: enemy army in sight or seen in 30 s, enemy buildings ever seen)
or move (any other order of 2+ cells). Each with the cluster's commitment:
its last order's label (engage or move, none if none in COMMIT_S), that order the last one whose
path (from where the group stood to where it was sent) passes within 2 cells of the cluster: the
commitment follows the group on its way. And that order's age. Pros re-decide on events, not a timer: the model learns the triggers from the state.

  tick_grid (9, 256)  as an order's grid, channel 8 the cluster's supply at its center
  tick_frame, tick_units, tick_seen, tick_eco  as for orders
  tick_label  0 keep, 1 engage, 2 move;  tick_target  the order's cell (-1 keep)
  tick_commit 0 none, 1 engage, 2 move;  tick_age  seconds since that order
  tick_loss (256,)    the player's own losses in the last LOSS_S seconds, where they died (a worker 2, a
                      fighter its supply x2, a building 4; capped at 255): what a pro reacts to, a raid on
                      the mineral line, that the grid of where units stand doesn't show (v3; c10: Gary-Z's
                      army kept its commitment while its drones went from 13 to 2)
  tick_static (256,)  the enemy's ground static defense the player knew of, where it stands (sunken, cannon,
                      bunker, each STATIC_SUPPLY: gary/policy/army.py; capped at 255), known from the first look
                      at its cell (an enemy building in sight there) until it dies: the other buildings' channel
                      counts a sunken as an Evolution Chamber, so a model couldn't learn when pros attack into
                      static defense (v4; the static guard, a stop-gap in AGENTS.md)
  tick_known (256,)   the enemy buildings the player knew of still standing, by cell: as tick_static, from the
                      first look at the cell after it was begun until it dies (channel 6 never forgets one, so
                      a model couldn't tell no building left: the scripted hunt's trigger)
  tick_unseen (256,)  seconds / UNSEEN_PER (gary/policy/army.py) since the player's own units were last in each cell,
                      capped at 255 (the bases not seen lately: the hunt's search) (v5)
  tick_air            1 for a cluster of fighting flyers (gary/races.py AIR_FIGHTERS: Corsairs, Mutalisks, Wraiths,
                      ...; not the Shuttles and Observers that go with the army), clustered apart from the ground
                      army from MIN_AIR (one Corsair); an order is theirs when it sends MIN_AIR of them, the
                      ground's when it sends MIN_SUP of the rest (both when sent together). A lone Corsair over the
                      Zerg's main was in no sample, and the pros see the Spire with one in 68% of PvZ games (#16) (v6)
  tick_flyers (256,)  the own army's fighting flyers by cell (supply x2): where the air clusters stand (v6)
  tick_ctarget        the cell the cluster's commitment sends it to (its order's target), -1 none: the pros' re-orders
                      of a Corsair within 10 s go within a cell of the last target 63% of the time, a model that knew
                      only the commitment's kind and age drew Gary-P's anew, 20% (v6)

Output: data/interim/army/v5/<sha1[:2]>/<sha1>.npz and data/interim/army/v5/index.jsonl. Needs a
gary_resim whose "gone" events carry the owner and the place (resim/gary_resim.cpp).
