"""Build orders from replay commands, with a confidence for each item.

Replays record what players *ordered*, not what happened: a build can fail (blocked spot, no
money), be retried, or be cancelled. Without re-simulating the game, each item is classified by
the evidence available in the command stream:

  confirmed   a later command could only have been issued if this item existed
              (training zerglings proves a spawning pool; morphing a lair proves the pool too)
  ordered     ordered, not cancelled, but no later command proves it
  cancelled?  a cancel command was issued shortly after and is attributed to this item (heuristic)

Repeated orders of the same building at the same spot within a few seconds are collapsed into
one item (the last attempt), with `attempts` counting them.

Re-simulation is the ground truth; this extractor's error rate gets measured against it once
resim exists (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §7.3).

Output: data/interim/build_orders.jsonl, one record per player per game.

Usage:
  python ingest/build_orders.py --matchup TvZ           # all TvZ games in the inventory
  python ingest/build_orders.py --matchup TvZ --limit 200
  python ingest/build_orders.py --report
