# AGENTS.md

How to work in this repository, for coding agents and people alike. The design is in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); what each version did and how it measured is in
[docs/PROGRESS.md](docs/PROGRESS.md) (keep it updated after each milestone); open work is in the GitHub issues, indexed in [TODO.md](TODO.md) (a done item's issue is closed
and its line removed; a new one gets an issue and a line).

## Where things are

- `gary/`: the agent (`gary/agent`: arbiter, executor and its race plugs, macro, army, fight, rules), the
  race data (`gary/terran.py`, `zerg.py`, `protoss.py`, `race.py`), the learned models (`gary/policy`), the
  interface (human-like hands) and the game environment.
- `eval/`: the launcher (`match.py`), league rounds (`league.py`, which keeps each round's feature rows), measures
  against the pros (`humanlike.py`, `attacks.py`, `style_adherence.py`: the build per style; `placement.py`: where the buildings stand against the pros', `tiles.py`: on which tiles; `transfers.py`: workers at a new base as it finishes), two versions compared game against game: their paired score with its spread and what 96 games resolve
  (`paired.py`: a game at time graded by supply or by the critics) and their gap per time window with a
  bootstrap spread (`gap_windows.py`), the records' queries (`why.py`), the judge (`judge.py`: would a pro's unit be in this mode in the situation Gary's is in, a model of the pros' fight moments checked on held-out pro games, then Gary's league rounds against it; `mode_hazard.py`: how often a unit enters and leaves the mode per half second, by the judge's odds, against the pros), the critic's calibration and would-gg games (`critic_gg.py`), the run monitor (`monitor.py`,
  `priority.py`).
- `train/`, `ingest/`, `resim/`: models, datasets from replays, the replay re-simulator (`train/modes.py`: a mode's entry and exit by situation, `gary/policy/modes.py`, the inputs the judge reads).
- `adapters/scr_bridge`: playing StarCraft: Remastered. `tests/`: smoke, parity, matchups, game data, the live path.
- `docs/`: ARCHITECTURE (design), CONTROL (layers and manifests), RACES (the per-race audit), REFACTOR (one
  Gary for every race, done), SELF_PLAY (the self-play plan), DATA_ERAS (old and modern replays).

## The Garys and how to judge a change

- One Gary for every race: manifest `gt1` plays Terran, `gz1` Zerg, `gp1` Protoss (crude, gp0.5: docs/REFACTOR.md
  Phase 4) (`gary/agent/manifests.py`). Every game
  runs through `python -m eval.match --a <manifest> --b <manifest>`; `python -m eval.league` plays Terran
  (`--vs`, default gt1) against Zerg (`--zerg`, default gz1); `gary/play.py --live` plays a human. A side's build
  style is told by name or id (`--style`, and `--style-b` for B in eval.match; `--list-styles` prints each race's per
  matchup from the catalogue `gary/styles.py`, every game labelled by `taxonomy/label_all.py`).
- Two Terran manifests: `gt1` is what plays (the strongest measured: human games, the tests' parity, the league's
  default) and `gt1dev` is what learning is trained and judged in: gt1 with the role model deciding in contact and
  the army on control groups, the configuration expected to win later, and without the stop-gaps over the layers
  being learned (option `unscripted`: the static guard, the hunt, the overlord hunt, the pros' caps, the SCV cap, the
  bank escape), so the models own those decisions there (the models' inputs in play are counted as their training data counts them
  in every build: gt1's since gt0.12, held by `tests/test_inputs.py` with `GARY_TEST_T=gt1 GARY_TEST_Z=gz1`); a stop-gap stays in gt1 while it
  measurably helps, and its
  job in gt1dev is the learned layer's or nobody's. `gz1dev` is the same for the Zerg (gz1 with `unscripted`: join,
  sweep, press, the hunt, the caps, the bank escape and overlords ahead off; its overlord posts and mutalisk raid
  kept, as no model moves those units; decoders such as the tech floor are not stop-gaps and stay). `gp1dev` is the
  same for the Protoss (gp1 with `unscripted`: the hunt and a Pylon ahead of production off; its army on control
  groups by type); its PvT and PvZ rounds play gt1dev and gz1dev, its PvP rounds gp1dev. gt1dev against
  gz1dev is the TvZ self-play pairing (balanced: each side wins or leads in 38% of 96 games; gt0.18dev against gz0.6dev
  35% and 42% of 48, docs/PROGRESS.md). A learned layer's work (data, training, the
  pipe check, RL) is done and judged in gt1dev. **Promotion** (2026-11-11, the same for every race): the dev build
  replaces the playing build, with a version bump, when (1) it is nearer the pros than the playing build, or as near,
  on the fidelity measures in every time window (the gap score per window with its spread, eval/gap_windows.py; the
  build per style, eval/style_adherence.py; the bank and the decision rate from the records), and (2) in 96 paired
  games against the same fixed opponent it is not measurably worse: the pairing's interval holds zero, or its loss is
  under the minimum detectable effect written before the round. It need not win more: the playing build keeps the
  stop-gaps that measurably win, and the dev build is judged on playing like the pros without them (fidelity before
  wins, below); a stop-gap that measurably wins keeps its entry and its measure, but no longer blocks the promotion by
  itself. Until then the rule was "beats it in 96 paired games", which no dev build could meet while the jobs the
  stop-gaps do (finishing games most of all) have no learned layer. The suite's numbers for both, and how far apart they
  are, are in docs/PROGRESS.md.
- A change is an option on them (`gt1+<option>`), judged in paired 48-game rounds on the ladder maps
  (`--maps ladder --seeds 6 --first 4004`, 30 minutes) and the gap score to modern pros; 24 games are too
  noisy for close calls, and a single round's gap score needs its spread (`eval/gap_windows.py`, 96 paired games
  for a close call). A round is proposed only with its minimum detectable effect written first: 96 paired games
  resolve 0.06 to 0.14 of the paired score by the pairing (its 90% interval +-0.04 to +-0.09 over eleven past pairs:
  `eval/paired.py` prints a pairing's own), so
  an option expected to move less is judged on its own check (the records, the fidelity measures) or not by rounds at
  all. A round is sized to the effect it looks for: a fidelity measure expected to move severalfold (workers at a new
  base 1.1 to 5.4, a building at the natural 0% to 88%) shows in 16 games, and 48 are for a close call. An adopted option is folded into the manifest with a version bump, so the name
  never grows into a chain of options. A close 48-game round gets its second 48 (`--first 4010`) at the first
  round's priority, without asking. A baseline is replayed whenever its code or the opponent's manifest changed (a
  baseline from a worktree against an older gz1 once misjudged an option). A plain bug fix, or a model's input counted
  as its training data counts it, is adopted on its own check (the records, tests/test_inputs.py), not on rounds: if
  Gary plays worse with it, a model was leaning on the bug, and that is what to look into. A stop-gap that makes no measurable
  difference in 96 paired games goes once a learned layer has an output for its job (one that has none is judged on
  its entry's fidelity measure: a Gary that never stims can win as many games). A
  learned change that fails its 96 games is reviewed before the next try: a bug (the records, `eval.why`), inputs
  the model lacks for the decision, or the limit of what the data teaches; the finding goes in docs/PROGRESS.md.
- **Fidelity before wins.** Gary is a sparring partner meant to play like the pros, so a change that moves it toward
  the pros' play (the build the pros play, the inputs the models learned from, a decoder that samples the pros'
  timings) is judged first on whether Gary now does it (build timings and counts per style against the pros of that
  style on the same maps, eval/style_adherence.py, never overall against overall; the gap score,
  the pipe and input checks) and on wins second. Simple cheesy plans (style 4, two-Barracks gasless marines, 1.5% of
  pro Terran games) are expected to win more against weak opponents like gz1 and Gary itself, so a drop in wins
  when leaving one is not a verdict. If such a change loses games, it is not abandoned: look for what stops it
  working (bugs, execution leaks, inputs, the decoder) and fix those, keeping the change on in the dev manifest
  meanwhile. The mistake this rule exists for: on 2026-10-23 styleroll (the pros' styles by share in place of the
  selector's style 4) was dropped for winning 26 of 48 against 31, though its own review found the cause was
  execution (gas mined and not spent, Barracks busy, production never added), and gt1dev went on playing style 4
  through every macro fix built for that failure. Options that only bet on results (a stop-gap, a tuned threshold)
  are still judged on results.
- Before any learning run beyond imitation, the rules in docs/SELF_PLAY.md ("Learning beyond imitation"): the
  pipe check shows pushed logits move what Gary executes; the model owns the decision in play and in the judging
  games; branched decisions are locked for the window (the pros' hold lengths); the minimum detectable effect
  is written down before a gate; learning from counterfactuals is offline. No online PPO on small batches.
- Gary loads the newest `runs/<kind>/<matchup>_<race>_*` model; experiments go to `--out` so they stay out of
  that glob.
- Make fixes reusable: race-keyed tables and shared providers rather than race-specific code, so the other
  races and matchups get them too.

## Working rules

- Never edit agent code while a league round runs: each game is a new process importing the code.
- Stopping a job's shell leaves its pool workers running: stop a run with `python -m eval.stop <pid>` (or
  `--match <text>`), which kills its whole process tree. Killed re-simulator calls aren't indexed as failures, so
  a rerun builds them. Kill leftover `gary_resim.exe` before rebuilding the simulator (the link fails otherwise).
- After executor or macro edits run `tests/test_smoke_game.py`, and `tests/test_pairs.py` before any run with
  paired branches (the bots' deep copy and a branch's replay, in under a minute); `tests/test_value.py` fails when
  the critic can't read the current Gary (a change of the macro features: retrain it, `python -m train.value
  --since <date>`, from the league's replays); `tests/test_inputs.py` (about 5 minutes) holds the vectors the macro, army
  and critic are fed in play against their datasets' for the same game, after any change to a model's inputs, a
  tracker or a dataset builder (a new difference fails it; its INTENDED and KNOWN lists, with issues, say what may
  differ); a change of behaviour records the parity
  hashes again (`tests/test_parity.py --record`) in its commit, with the reason; `tests/test_matchups.py`
  plays every matchup that can play; `tests/test_live.py` (a minute) plays each race's dev build through the live
  launcher on a stand-in for the bridge, after any change to the live path (`gary/scr_env.py`, `gary/play.py`) or to
  what the agent asks of the game (a new `Game` method, a new observation field).
- "Why did Gary do that?" is answered from the game's records (`python -m eval.why`) before writing a
  re-simulation probe.
- Long scripts report to the run monitor (`eval.monitor`, `eval.priority`).
- The repository is public: no local paths, machine details or personal information in files; the
  StarCraft install is passed at runtime (`GARY_SC_INSTALL`). No Blizzard game data and no GPL code
  (CONTRIBUTING.md). Gary never plays on the Battle.net ladder.

## Stop-gaps

Gary's decisions are meant to be learned (imitation of the pros, then self-play). Some are scripted rules
today because the learned layer can't do them yet and the rule measurably helps now. Before adding a
scripted rule, weigh whether it should stay a rule or become learned behaviour. If it is a stop-gap, tag it
in the code with `STOP-GAP (AGENTS.md)` and give it an entry below: what it does, why it is scripted for now,
what should replace it, and the measure that says it can go. When a learned layer takes over its job, run
the measure with the rule off; if the learned layer holds, delete the rule and its entry.

Not stop-gaps: the hands (clicks, selection, mining, rallies, placement mechanics), decoders (how a model's
odds become a choice: dice, hold, floors), and fixes of plain bugs.

- **Overlord hunt** (option `lords`, in gt1; `army_rules.py` LordHunt). An enemy overlord in sight with no
  fighters, sunkens or spores near it: the two nearest free shooters hunt it (race tables: marines;
  hydralisks and dragoons listed, not yet played). Scripted because neither the army nor the fight layer
  decides small detachments. Replace with a learned detachment decision (split off N units for a target).
  Measure: overlords killed by 8:00 with no more marines lost (16 games: 8 to 21, 116 to 107 lost).
- **The hunt far ahead and squad search** (options `hunt4`, `split`, in gt1; the hunt in gp1 too; `army.py` hunt_ahead,
  hunt_split). The hunt also runs at 4x the enemy fighters seen in the last minute; with no enemy building
  known, squads of 8+ search the unseen bases at once. Scripted because the commit model's engages scatter
  when the enemy is nearly dead, and it has no notion of finishing or searching. Replace with the commit or
  army model trained with a reward for ending games (self-play) and searching as a learned scouting skill.
  Measure: games won against gz1 in 48 (24 with it, 21 without) and leads unfinished at 20:00. The hunt begins a
  quarter of gt1's attacks and goes into sunkens most (0.63 of its attacks, the commit model's 0.38: eval/attacks.py,
  2026-10-23); the static guard doesn't screen it. Imitated (2026-10-24): gt1dev runs it in advice mode
  (`huntadvice`, play unchanged) and train/commit.py --rule-labels learns its advice; the models follow it where it
  acts (0.81) and finish more leads, but copy its attacks into sunkens, and on v5's data trail the deployed commit
  model in games, so not adopted yet (docs/PROGRESS.md). Tried on gz1 with the
  static guard (48 games against gt1): the Zerg won 1 (2), so off for Zerg. Back on in the dev builds (2026-11-11, 48 paired games each): gt1dev decided 46% of its games for
  33% and +0.057 [+0.000, +0.120] against gz1; gp1dev 46% for 29%, +0.021 [-0.021, +0.057] against gz1dev, behind at
  time in 11 games for 8: a fifth and a sixth of their deficits to the playing builds (docs/PROGRESS.md), so off
  there still.
- **Static-defense guard on engages** (options `static` and `softguard`, in gt1; `army.py` static_odds,
  static_beta). An engage's spots where the group doesn't outweigh 1.5 times the ground static defense there (6
  supply each) and the enemy fighters seen near it keep (the group / 1.5 times that) squared of their odds: a nudge
  since gt0.10 (96 paired games against the veto it was: -0.016 +- 0.035, no measurable difference). Scripted because the commit model doesn't weigh static defense (human game 4's
  three attacks all went into sunkens). Replace with static defense as a commit-model input and its outcomes
  in training. Measure: the attacks' trade (`eval/attacks.py`): supply killed / lost 78.8 / 44.8 a game with
  it, 71.9 / 52.6 without; 2026-10-23 (NG70a against Q60a, gt0.7): lost / killed 70.9 / 92.6 off, 60.6 / 87.8 on,
  over 96 paired games (NG70a+b against Q60a+Q70b) worse off, -0.062 +- 0.044: it stays. The pros attack where it forbids (29% of their engages into
  static defense are under its 1.5x), and a commit model that sees static defense learned nothing more (army dataset
  v4: docs/PROGRESS.md).
- **Gather before engaging** (option `gather`, not adopted; `army.py` `_gather_start`, `_gather_step`). A commit
  engage with a quarter of the army's supply elsewhere first brings the whole army to its own middle (at least
  12 tiles from the target), then attacks once 75% of it is there or 20 s pass. It only delays the engage, never
  vetoes it: enemies at home don't call it off (whether to attack anyway is the model's; moving out is often what
  ends a mutalisk harass). Scripted because each cluster's commit decision is taken alone: two thirds of Gary-T's late
  arrivals at its attacks were units that existed when the attack began. Replace with the commit model learning
  to gather before it engages (the pros' "move" commitments include regrouping), then self-play. Measure: late
  arrivals per fighter at attacks (`eval/attacks.py`: Gary-T 0.27, pros 0.06) and 96 paired games. Measured
  2026-10-20 (96 paired games against gt1): the 10-15 minute gap nearer the pros (-0.045, interval below zero),
  lost 6 (9), but won 47 (54), more games at 30:00; late arrivals 0.26 to 0.22 only.
- **The pros' caps per minute** (in gt1 and gz1; `macro.py` plan, `capped`; the model's `cap`). A unit, building or
  expansion is refused once Gary has more than nine pros in ten ever had by that minute. The commonest veto of
  the model's decisions: 8,293 options set aside in 48 games of gt1 (Marines 2,963, Medics 1,320, Science Vessels
  988, turrets 781, Firebats 539, Barracks 483, depots 470, Control Towers 303). Scripted because a decoded
  unlikely choice could run away (v0.14's era). Partly a consequence of keep_busy (removed in gt0.7: its marines
  pushed the counts over the cap): 0.63 options refused a decision with it, 0.46 without. Replace with the model's
  own odds (it knows the counts it has; calibrated on the pros' states, the macro check). Measure: option `nocaps`
  against gt1, results and the macro gap. Off (round NC70a against Q60a, 2026-10-23): lost 10 (5), the macro gap
  +0.070 [+0.013, +0.125], turrets at 10-20 minutes 16.4 (pros 7.1, with it 9.2), medics 1.3 (4.4): the caps clean
  up after the decoder (the bank escape and the under-half rule take the runner-up while the favorite waits), so
  they go after those.
- **SCVs capped at the bases' saturation** (in gt1; `terran_executor.py`, "SCVs enough for its bases", MAX_SCVS 60).
  The model's SCV decisions are refused beyond the bases' saturation (2,673 times in 48 games, most at 5-15
  minutes). Scripted because Gary over-made SCVs (2026-10-09: 42-51 at 12:00 against the pros' 39). Gary-T's
  Command Centers stand idle 93% of 10-20 minutes, the pros' 84%. Replace with the model's own SCV decisions.
  Measure: an option off: workers at 12-20 minutes against the pros', results and the macro gap. Off (round NS70a,
  2026-10-23): workers at 10-20 minutes 48.6 (pros 42.4, with it 39.0), the macro gap +0.077 [+0.031, +0.122]; 1,335
  of its 2,206 SCVs at 5-20 minutes were the decoder's runner-up, not the model's favorite.
- **Under half the waiting favorite's odds** (in gt1 and gz1; `macro.py`, the decoder). While the model's favorite
  waits for a busy building, alternatives under half its odds are passed over and the macro waits (2,104 times:
  depots 614, SCVs 458, Barracks 242, refineries 164, Engineering Bays 146, Siege Tanks 62). Scripted so a busy
  building doesn't hand the turn to unlikely choices. With the queue of waiting decisions (gt0.7) a favorite unit
  no longer holds the macro; measure how often this still fires there, and an option without it.
- **The bank escape** (in gt1 and gz1; `macro.py` the decoder, BANK_ESCAPE 400). While the model's favorite waits, with
  over 400 minerals anything Gary can do now is taken instead. With the caps off it made 341 of the 1,174 turrets at
  5-20 minutes, and 759 of the 2,206 SCVs with the SCV cap off. Scripted so money doesn't bank behind a busy
  building. Replace with the model's own odds (it reads its minerals: pros with a bank add production) and a deeper
  queue of its waiting units (option `qdepth2`). Measure: option `nobank`, the bank, results and the macro gap. Off
  (NB70a against Q60a, 2026-10-23): paired -0.203 +- 0.123, the macro gap +0.208, minerals banked at 5-15 minutes
  1,124 (pros 511, with it 387): while the favorite waits it stays the macro's goal and the model isn't asked again,
  so it never gets to add production; with qdepth2 too (QD70a) 675 banked, -0.078, the gap +0.052. It covers for
  the one goal at a time; next, the model's units queued in the building and paid for, as pros do (gamequeue,
  adopted in gt0.9; the escape still holds with it: off as well, -0.130 +- 0.152). In gt1dev (escape off) the macro
  draws from the model's odds (dice, gt0.11dev); rethink and nosave, which drop a waiting goal, were worse in games.
  What filled gt1dev's bank, read from the records (2026-11-11, gt0.33dev): not the favorite's wait but the hands', one
  builder walking at a time and every build decided behind it held 30 s as the goal (the expansion decided again
  until its hall stood); with that fixed in every build, gt1dev banks less than the pros at 15-25 minutes
  (docs/PROGRESS.md). The escape's own measure in gt1 stands as written.
- **Odds summed into a decision** (`mass` for one-offs, in gt1: tech buildings, add-ons, research, upgrades;
  `expand_mass` for expansions; `macro.py` odds_mass, expand_odds). A one-off is decided once its odds, summed over
  the decisions taken while it was possible, reach one (278 times in 48 games), an expansion likewise (194).
  Decoders, but they decide on their own schedule rather than the model's odds of the moment. Scripted because
  the favorite (almost always a unit) never let a few-percent tech building come (a Factory by 8:00 in 4% of
  games against the pros' 62%). Measure: their decisions' timings against the pros' (build orders), and an option
  without them once the decoder draws (dice) everywhere.
- **Answers to the enemy's plan** (`answers.py`, in gt1). Lurkers or mutalisks read from what Gary saw force Siege
  Mode, tanks, vessels, Irradiate and turrets (443 forced decisions in 48 games) and veto turrets beyond one a base
  (387). Scripted because the macro model didn't answer what it had seen (human games 1-2). Replace with the seen
  enemy units as macro-model inputs (they are: the `seen` counts) and measure whether the model answers alone. In
  play its "most seen" inputs stayed 0 until option `seenall` (2026-10-25: the tracker looked only when the model was
  queried); gt1 has it since gt0.12, so the answers can be measured off now.
  Measure: an option off, against lurker and mutalisk plans: results and the time to the answer.
- **The early-pool posture's builds** (in gt1; off in gt1dev since gt0.18dev, option noalarm: it went to rush defense in
  every game, half of them blind, and held the opening's gas and natural back; rush defense from scouting: bunker at the ramp, marines first, no
  expansion). Forces 454 decisions and blocks expansion 145 times in 48 games. Scripted for 9-pool and 12-pool
  rushes (v0.11-v0.18, losses 27 of 48 to the pro-timed 9-pool before it). Replace with the posture as a learned
  read of the scouting (the posture's alarm a model input). Measure: losses to early pools (eval/vs_rush.py) and
  the gap at 0-10 minutes with it off.
- **The pros' decision history** (in gz1; off in gz1dev since gz0.12dev; `manifests.py` history "pro",
  `gary/policy/macro.py` the tracker's history). The macro model's "decisions so far" inputs are the pros' mean for its
  style at that minute, fading to its own over 12 minutes, its overlords (ownsupply) its own. Scripted because
  Gary-Z's own drone-heavy past fed back on itself (60-70% drones at 6:00-7:30, the pros' 17-24%), before the dice
  decoder and the queue of waiting decisions; the Terran and the Protoss read their own (the Terran with it, prohist,
  won 21 lost 10 of 48 against 30 and 5, 2026-10-23). It breaks the rule that inputs in play are counted as the data
  counts them. Measured off in gz1dev (option ownhist, 2026-10-30, 96 paired games against gt1dev): drones 27% of its
  decisions at 6:00-7:30 (26% with it), the Zerg's score +0.039 +- 0.092, the macro gap -0.022 [-0.142, +0.094]: no
  measurable difference, so off there. It goes from gz1 when gz1dev replaces it (gz1's older model untested without it);
  if the loop comes back, the fix is in training (the history noised, or dropped as an input), the same for every race.
- **The Terran's fight rules** (in gt1 and gt1dev; `fight.py` PullRule, LoadRule, RepairRule, ReinforceRule, DetectRule;
  orders in 48 games of gt1dev, BT179a: load 3,156, reinforce 954, detect 922, repair 344, pull 313). No learned layer
  has an output for any of these jobs: the role model's roles are fire, close in, pull back, retreat, reposition,
  stand, siege, unsiege and mine, for fighters in contact, and it decides no workers (`workers: False`); the army
  model moves clusters, not a unit just out of its Barracks. So none of them can be measured off on a score: off, Gary
  simply never does the thing. Each goes when a learned layer owns its job in play (its output executed, the pipe
  check) and, with the rule off, holds the rule's fidelity measure against the pros. For the other races they are
  option `fightrules` (pull and reinforce): no difference in the score in TvZ, PvZ or PvT (2026-10-31,
  docs/PROGRESS.md), but on the pull's own measure Gary-P lost 1.17 Probes a game fewer to raids at 3-8 minutes in
  PvZ (48 paired games, [-2.31, -0.15]; 2.31 a game, the pros 0.90), so on in gp1dev since gp0.20dev; off for the Zerg,
  whose raid losses are to be measured the same way.
  - *Pull* (per_enemy 3, ground only, up to 8 enemy supply): workers off the minerals against fighters at a base
    that outweigh the army there, back once calm for 5 s. Replace with worker roles in the role model (the pros' pulls
    in its fight data). Measure: the home defenses against the pros' (where they pull, when, how many, for how long;
    in the rule's docstring Gary pulled in 44 of 239 where the pros didn't, at 3.0 s against their 7.6, 7.5 SCVs
    against 6.5, 89 SCV-seconds against 62).
  - *Load* (always: every finished bunker kept loaded): marines into a bunker that isn't full. Replace with a
    bunker role (enter, leave) for marines in the role model. Measure: marines in bunkers per minute against the
    pros' (their right-clicks on a bunker), and bunker deaths with marines outside.
  - *Repair* (2 SCVs, 3 for a turret): the nearest free SCVs repair a damaged bunker or turret with zerg near.
    Replace with a repair role for workers in the role model. Measure: SCVs repairing per damaged bunker and turret
    against the pros', and bunkers and turrets lost.
  - *Reinforce*: fighters just out of a Barracks while zerg are at the base attack-move to the fight. Replace with
    the army model deciding new units' destination (a cluster at home under attack). Measure: army deaths with no
    other fighter within 6 tiles (48% of Gary's in the rule's docstring, the pros' 12%) and late arrivals at
    defenses (`eval/attacks.py`).
  - *Detect*: a scan on a lurker seen burrowing near Gary's fighters, or where they lose HP with nothing in sight
    (Comsat energy permitting). Scripted because no model decides scans (0 scans in 14 games against lurkers before
    it). Replace with scans as a learned decision (the pros' scans in the fight data, with lurkers burrowed or
    units hit unseen as inputs). Measure: time from a lurker burrowing near the army to the scan, against the
    pros', and units lost to lurkers.
  - *Stim* is not a stop-gap: its decision is the stim model's (`gary/policy/stim.py`, learned from the pros'
    stims); the rule is its decoder (every half second, Stim Packs done, an HP floor). Measure that it stays: stims
    per fight and HP at the stim against the pros'.
- **Older rules, to review** (scripted before 2026-10-20; each needs a full entry when next worked on): Gary-Z's
  alarm and the natural colonies; the first producer by a time (`rax_by`); the v0.16 hunt and base scans; the fight
  layer's other rules (the Zerg roles' retreat when outweighed; RoleAhead's hand rules in contact, gt1's whole fight
  in contact); Gary-Z's army rules (posts, raid, join, sweep, press).

## When a new replay pack lands

```
python ingest/inventory.py --source cwal
python resim/run_batch.py --source cwal --remastered
python ingest/build_orders.py --source cwal
for m in TvZ PvT PvZ PvP ZvZ TvT: python ingest/{macro,army,fight}_dataset.py --matchup $m --source cwal
python -m train.macro --matchup TvZ --race Z --weight-modern 10      # judge with --test-era modern
```

Both eras with the modern games weighted ten to one is the measured recipe (docs/DATA_ERAS.md).
