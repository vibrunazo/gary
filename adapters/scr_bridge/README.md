# scr_bridge — Gary's StarCraft: Remastered adapter

Gary plays a **live Remastered client** through this adapter: it reads the game state the
client is simulating and injects Gary's commands as the local player's actions. That is what
lets Gary practice against real humans in custom games (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` "Game Adapter",
the "SC:R via bridge" backend).

**Status: v0 spike — skeleton validated live.** The build, hash pin, DLL injection, frame
watcher, pipe protocol and `gary.env.Game` surface all run against a real SC:R client on this
machine (`launch.py --smoke`: `ping: pong`, `hash_verified: true`, `frame_watcher: true`). Field offsets
marked `UNVERIFIED` in [`src/scr_profile.h`](src/scr_profile.h) must still pass the in-game probe
(below) before trusting observations. This document is the design record;
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is deliberately *not* updated until the adapter is shown to play.

## The recipe: Shieldbattery's skeleton + Pluto's control + Gary's contract

Three projects cover the problem between them; we take one layer from each.

| Layer | Source | What we take |
|---|---|---|
| **Skeleton** (launch, inject, hook, frame pump, fail-safe) | [ShieldBattery](https://github.com/ShieldBattery/ShieldBattery) (`game/`, MIT) | In-process DLL architecture; "async side never touches game state, sync side lives in hooks"; verify-first startup; polite failure. |
| **Control** (issue orders as the player) | [Pluto-AI-Starcraft-Remaster](https://github.com/chan22222/Pluto-AI-Starcraft-Remaster) (**no license** — design only, no code copied) | Inject bot commands into Remastered's own turn queue via `send_command`; hold commands to match turn latency; JSONL log of every submitted packet; refuse to run on unknown binaries; drop commands on any fault but never kill the game. |
| **Contract** (what Gary sees and does) | `env/gary_env.cpp` + `gary/env.py` (this repo) | The `gary.env.Game` method surface and the exact `observe()` JSON schema, so `gary/interface.py` runs unchanged. |

We deliberately **skip** the Pluto bridge's BWAPI-4.4 / 1.16.1-memory-mirror layer. It exists
only because `pluto.dll` is binary-only and hard-codes 1.16.1 addresses. Gary speaks its own
contract over IPC, so we read SC:R structs directly and avoid that layer (and BWAPI's LGPL).

### License provenance (what may be copied, what may not)

| Source | License | Use in this folder |
|---|---|---|
| ShieldBattery `game/` | MIT | Architecture ideas; code copy allowed with notices |
| Pluto-AI-Starcraft-Remaster | **none declared** (all rights reserved) | **Design study + address facts only.** No code copied. Ask the author before copying |
| `external/screp` (command IDs/formats) | ISC-style (its repo) | Command table facts |
| `resim/gary_resim.cpp`, `env/gary_env.cpp` | this repo (MIT-0) | Translation logic (we already wrote the reverse direction), contract |

## How it works

```
launch.py ──finds SC:R (x86), checks SHA-256 against the profile pin
   │        writes gary_scr.json (pipe name, log path) next to gary_scr.dll
   │        scr_inject.exe starts StarCraft.exe **-launch** (the game exits immediately without
   │        this flag) suspended, loads gary_scr.dll (CreateRemoteThread + LoadLibraryW), resumes
   ▼
inside StarCraft.exe (32-bit):
   DllMain ──init thread──► verify exe hash ──► resolve profile RVAs against the module
   │                        start frame watcher thread: poll Game.frame_count (no game
   │                        patches and no hooks — see "Frame source" below)
   │                        start NDJSON named-pipe server (SEH-guarded dispatch)
   ▼
per completed simulation frame (the watcher):
   ├─ frame counter sync (Game.frame_count is ground truth)
   ├─ drain the act() outbox ──► translate legacy→1.21 commands ──► scr send_command()
   └─ (future: update an immutable snapshot; v0 reads memory at request time)
   ▼
gary/scr_env.py (ScrGame) ──same methods as gary.env.Game──► gary/interface.py ──► bots
```

Design notes, following the two reference projects:

- **Nothing in the game is patched.** A watcher thread polls `Game.frame_count` and flushes
  queued commands at frame boundaries; everything else runs on the pipe thread (Shieldbattery's
  async/sync split). Every request runs under an SEH guard: a bad memory read degrades to an
  error reply, never a dead connection or a crashed game.
- **Verify, then trust.** The executable's SHA-256 must match the pinned build (1.23.10.13515
  x86); `hash_verified` gates every state-reading request. A game patch fails closed with a
  clear message instead of reading garbage — the Pluto bridge's discipline. Later we can add
  `samase_scarf`-style runtime re-discovery (Shieldbattery's approach) to survive patches
  automatically.
- **Degrade, don't die.** If the frame watcher has not seen a frame yet (menu/loading), `act()`
  submits at request time and `step()` sleeps in real time, instead of refusing service. The
  watcher is an optimization of timing, not a correctness requirement.

### Frame source (v0 hook → v1 watcher)

v0 followed the Pluto bridge and hooked `GetTickCount` (loader import table + the game's cached
pointer at `kTimingTickPtr`, per [PL]). Live testing on this build showed neither indirection
point engages: the game imports no `GetTickCount` IAT slot (`iat_slots: 0` in
`build/logs/scr_bridge.log`) and the cached pointer never became patchable — the frame counter
stayed 0 and queued `act()` commands silently never flushed. v1 instead polls `Game.frame_count`
(10 ms) and treats each advance as the frame boundary: zero game patches, no call-site facts,
self-healing across input/timing differences. The turn queue tolerates the ≤10 ms jitter (turn
latency is ≥2 frames).

## Gary's contract (parity with `env/gary_env.cpp`)

`ScrGame` in [`gary/scr_env.py`](../../gary/scr_env.py) implements the same methods
[`gary/env.py`](../../gary/env.py)'s `Game` does, so `gary/interface.py` and the bots are
backend-agnostic:

| Method | Meaning | SC:R implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `observe()` | full state as JSON (schema below) | Game/Player/Unit/Sprite structs per `scr_profile.h` |
| `act(slot, bytes)` | one command, replay-format bytes (no player-id byte) | translate to 1.21 command, inject at the next frame boundary via `send_command` |
| `step(frames)` | advance N frames | wait until `Game.frame_count` advances by N (the game steps itself) |
| `unit_at(slot, x, y)` | tag a click would hit | clickable image-union + draw depth (gary_env's model; bbox fallback, see gaps) |
| `box_select(slot, ...)` | tags a drag box would select (≤12) | same rules as `gary_env_box_select`: own units, mobile before buildings |
| `unit_type_of(tag)` | unit type id | unit struct `unit_id` field |
| `can_place(...)` | green/red placement grid | buildable tiles + collision + depot distance (v1 approx, see gaps) |
| `depot_spot_ok(tx, ty)` | map knowledge for base finding | `gary_env_depot_spot_ok`'s algorithm over the game's tile flags |
| `start_locations()` | map knowledge | `Game.start_position` |
| `set_name` / `save_replay` | — | not applicable: the client writes its own replay (see gaps) |

`observe()` JSON — byte-for-byte the schema of `gary_env_observe`:

```json
{"frame": 1234,
 "map": {"w": 4096, "h": 3072},
 "players": [{"slot": 0, "name": "...", "race": 1, "minerals": 50, "gas": 0,
              "supply_used": 4, "supply_max": 10, "victory_state": 0}],
 "units": [{"tag": 1031, "owner": 0, "type": 7, "x": 111, "y": 222,
            "hp": 40, "shields": 0, "completed": 1, "visible_to": 255,
            "order": 2, "resources": 0, "queue": 0}]}
```

`tag` is a **16-bit opaque handle** exactly like `gary_env`'s (OpenBW `unit_id` layout:
`index+1 | generation<<11`), so `gary/commands.py`'s `<H>` fields work unchanged. Under the hood
the adapter translates tags ↔ SC:R's extended unit ids (`index1 | gen << (13 or 11)`; 3400-unit

## Commands: legacy → 1.21 translation (the Pluto control layer, reimplemented)

Gary emits legacy replay-format commands (`gary/commands.py`). Remastered 1.21+ has variants of
exactly **six** commands with 32-bit unit ids (an extra zero u16 after each id in the wire
format); everything else passes through unchanged. Facts from `resim/gary_resim.cpp` (which
translates the reverse direction) and `external/screp/rep/repcmd/types.go` (which names both
families):

| legacy (Gary) | 1.21 (SC:R queue) | change |
|---|---|---|
| `0x09` select | `0x63` | each unit tag u16 → SC:R id u32 |
| `0x0a` select-add | `0x64` | same |
| `0x0b` select-remove | `0x65` | same |
| `0x14` right-click | `0x60` | target tag u16 → u32 |
| `0x15` targeted order | `0x61` | target tag u16 → u32 |
| `0x29` unload | `0x62` | unit tag u16 → u32 |
| everything else | unchanged | e.g. `0x0c` build, `0x1f` train, `0x23` morph |

Every translated packet is appended to `logs/scr_commands.jsonl` as
`{"command_frame", "queued_frame", "packet_hex", "submitted"}` — a small piece of the Trace Bus
and the ground truth for the replay cross-check (the same commands must appear in the `.rep`
SC:R saves, parseable with `tools/bin/screp.exe`).

**Latency.** Commands enter the game's turn queue and land a few frames later. v0 submits at the
next completed frame and records `queued_frame`; the measured observation→effect delay is then
fed to `gary/interface.py`'s pending/reaction model. (The Pluto bridge measured 4 frames against
its training environment and held packets one frame to match; SC:R multiplayer estimates
`latencyFrames = ceil(24·(2 + user_delay) / turn_rate)` from `0x1240e58+44` / `0x1241288` —
both recorded in `scr_profile.h` as calibration inputs. Nothing is assumed; the adapter
measures and reports.)

## Build and run

Requirements: Visual Studio C++ tools (same as `env/`), Python 3. Nothing else — no Rust, no
MinHook, no BWAPI.

```bat
adapters\scr_bridge\build.bat              &rem builds build\gary_scr.dll + build\gary_scr_tests.exe (32-bit!)
adapters\scr_bridge\build\gary_scr_tests.exe                          &rem offline unit tests
python adapters\scr_bridge\tools\verify_profile.py "D:\games\StarCraft\x86\StarCraft.exe"
python adapters\scr_bridge\launch.py --smoke                          &rem inject, ping/status/observe, exit
```

The DLL is **32-bit** (`build.bat` uses `vcvars32`) because the pinned target is the x86 client
(`x86\StarCraft.exe`) that the Pluto bridge also targets. The 64-bit client is a later step
(needs its own profile; `samase_scarf` discovery is the patch-survivable route).

Playing: `python adapters\scr_bridge\launch.py` starts SC:R with the bridge; then run a bot with
`--scr` (planned) or attach later — Gary only ever acts as the local player. Starting a game is
hands-free: `tools/auto_game.py` types the menu hotkeys (`S,E,O,U,O`) as **posted background
keys** — no clicks, no focus steal (verified 2026-10-03: a melee match started end-to-end with
the game unfocused; `PrintWindow` state shots land in `build/auto_game/`).

Human-vs-Gary on one desktop is the same idea over LAN. `auto_game.py --preset lan-create
--pid <bot pid>` posts `M,E,Down,O,O,G,O` (Multiplayer, Expansion, LAN — Down from the
preselected Battle.net — Ok, Ok on the first registry account, G=Create, Ok on the preselected
map) and lands in the lobby; `--preset lan-join --pid <human pid>` posts `M,E,Down,O,O,O` on
the second client to join it (the create page defaults to Top vs Bottom on Bottleneck, a fine
1v1). Then `--race T --row home` (bot) and `--race Z --row away` (human) pick races — SC:R
widgets ignore posted mouse messages, so these two clicks use real input and briefly raise the
bot's window (harmless: multiplayer never pauses unfocused) — and `--start` posts Alt+O for the
5s countdown. **Note the lobby semantics:** the bridge reports `in_game=true` while sitting in
the lobby (map size + local player are already set there), so `frames > 0` is the "match
running" signal (`auto_game.match_started()`), not `in_game`.

**Two instances on one machine** (needed for local human-vs-Gary practice): SC:R enforces a
single instance via the named kernel Event `\Sessions\1\BaseNamedObjects\Starcraft Check For
Other Instances` — a second client exits within seconds of the first (the x86 and x64 clients
share the check). `tools/close_mutex.py` closes that handle inside the running instance — the
automated Process Explorer step (`NtQuerySystemInformation` + `DuplicateHandle(
DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE)`; `--list`/`--all` for diagnosis) — and works **without elevation**
when the client runs as the same user. Verified 2026-10-03: two clients up, a LAN game created
in one and joined from the other, both clients running unfocused (LAN matches do not pause).
With two instances, `auto_game.py --pid N` / `end_match.py --pid N` target one window.

**x86 client only.** The pinned build facts are for `x86\StarCraft.exe`; a 32-bit DLL cannot
load into the 64-bit client, and the address profile would differ anyway. The x86 client plays
the same game against the same opponents (including x64 clients over Battle.net).



## Verification plan (what makes this adapter trustworthy)

1. **Offline (no game needed):** `gary_scr_tests.exe` — command translation golden vectors (the
   inverse of `resim/gary_resim.cpp`'s tested translator), handle-table stale-generation
   behavior, record lengths. `tests/test_scr_bridge.py` — protocol framing, `ScrGame` method
   parity with `gary.env.Game`, SHA-256 check of the pin against the real
   `D:\games\StarCraft\x86\StarCraft.exe`.
2. **Binary-level (install only, no game run):** `verify_profile.py` — PE parse, hash pin,
   RVA→file-offset mapping, code-site sanity bytes.
3. **Live probe (one custom game vs computer):** `tools/run_match.py` runs the whole loop
   (launch → inject → menu-click a melee game → `tools/probe_live.py`). **Executed 2026-10-03
   against 1.23.10.13515 x86 — every check passes:** exactly 2 players in a 1v1, 4 workers + a
   main building, mineral fields read real amounts (`raw_resources` == `observe.resources` ==
   1500 at `kUnitResources = 0xd0`, which replaces the earlier 204 — a window-start off-by-4
   artifact), frames advance while playing, and an `act()` select lands in the saved replay as
   `Select` **ID 99 (0x63)** for our player with the exact unit tag we sent (`screp.exe -cmds`:
   Frame 3527, PlayerID 0, UnitTags [11525]; the replay's `Frames` equals the bridge's final
   count, 9793). The shields auto-hunt found **`kUnitShields = 0x60`** uniquely across 21
   protoss units; the check re-verifies on any game where the (random) computer race is Protoss.
   End the match with `tools/end_match.py` to have the client write the replay.
4. **Cross-backend (the real test):** run the same scripted bot on OpenBW (`gary/env.py`) and on
   SC:R and decision-diff the traces (the harness planned for §7.2 desync checks).

## Known gaps (v0)

- Unit energy and the build-queue ring start (`kUnitEnergy` 168, `kUnitBuildSlot` 166 in
  `scr_profile.h`) are unverified and probably sit at 162 / 164 (BW 1.16's layout, which every
  pinned unit field so far has matched). Not used yet: pin both before energy enters the
  contract (spellcasters). The TODO next to them says how.
- `can_place` is an approximation (buildable tiles + collision + depot distance): the fog rule
  ("unexplored tiles not allowed") and creep/pylon-power rules need the game's own placement
  function (resolve via `samase_scarf` later) to match `gary_env_can_place` exactly.
- `unit_at`/`box_select` resolve clicks through the sprite's image chain: the union of the
  clickable images' GRP frames (gary_env's model; frame geometry from the game's own GRP files via
  tools/gen_image_dat.py, struct offsets pinned by tools/hunt_click.py against live memory).
  Residual gaps: sprites whose body image hangs off differently-encoded links fall back to the
  sprite bounding box (`hunt_click.py --check` measures the split), and the flip bit uses OpenBW's
  flag value pending a facing-left sample. Click-model fidelity between training (OpenBW) and live
  (SC:R) must be measured before G2 numbers are trusted (`hunt_click.py --gold` prints gary_env's
  reference boxes per unit type).
- `set_name`/`save_replay` are not implemented (the client writes its own replay on match end;
  `tools/end_match.py` ends a match through the F10 menu and locates it — here
  `D:\docs\StarCraft\Maps\Replays\LastReplay.rep`, since Documents is redirected on this machine).
- Observation reads memory on demand (pipe thread) rather than a frame-stamped snapshot; v1
  moves state capture onto the frame watcher tick like Shieldbattery does.
- `act()` timing is "next frame boundary"; observed effect latency is logged and must be
  calibrated into `gary/interface.py` before human-likeness evaluation.
- Control-group commands (replay command 0x13: assign / recall / add, groups 0-9) must pass
  through `act()`. Today the human interface fakes hotkeys by re-selecting the group's units, so a
  live replay shows no hotkey use at all ("Gary got owned", 2026-10-04) and looks unlike a
  human's; real players' replays, which Gary learns from, are full of them. The interface will
  switch to real 0x13 commands (OpenBW runs them), so verify the bridge sends them and the game
  applies them (the live replay should show `Hotkey` commands).
- The headless env now delays every command by `gary.env.LIVE_COMMAND_DELAY` (3 frames: the
  reported turn latency 2 + 1 hand-off). Re-measure it once a live game sends real hotkeys, and
  keep the two in step if the latency setting changes.
- x86 client only; single local player only. Starting custom games hands-free is automated
  (`tools/auto_game.py --mode keys` types the menu hotkeys as posted background keys; the
  calibrated screenshot+click flow remains as `--mode clicks`); joining arbitrary lobbies is not.
  SC:R menu facts encoded in the tool: the client restores its last menu screen on launch, only
  text labels are buttons, the single-player menu's "Cancel" and ESC at the top-level menu both
  quit the game, and the window flips windowed/fullscreen while loading (only the click flow
  cares — it normalizes to fullscreen, the calibrated layout). Menu hotkey letters (S=ingle
  player, E=xpansion, O=K, cU=stom game) work via posted keys on an unfocused window (verified
  2026-10-03: `S,E,O,U,O` started a melee match end-to-end with the game in the background), so
  the walk needs no visible screen. The client pauses while unfocused in offline games;
  multiplayer (Local PC) matches cannot pause — confirm once the two-instance setup exists.

- **Play offline only — never the Battle.net ladder** (`CONTRIBUTING.md` ground rules).

Command packets are built in the command-table mode per `resim/gary_resim.cpp`'s inverse
(legacy→1.21 translation, golden-vector tested in `gary_scr_tests.exe`).

`act()` accepts only the **local player's** slot (a live client can only act as itself); other
slots return "rejected", matching `gary_env_act`'s semantics (1 accepted / 0 rejected / -1 error).
