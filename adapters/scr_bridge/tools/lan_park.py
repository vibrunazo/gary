"""Park two SC:R clients at the multiplayer screens: host at Create Game, guest at the LAN list.

    python adapters/scr_bridge/tools/lan_park.py

Keyboard-only menu walks (posted keys, like auto_game.py --mode keys — no visible clicks):
  1. launch the first client and inject the Gary bridge (launch.py)
  2. host:  M,E,Down,O,O,G -> Multiplayer, Expansion, LAN (Down from the preselected
     Battle.net), Ok, Ok on the Gary account (first, preselected), G=Create game: STOP in
     the create-game dialog (the game is NOT created)
  3. close the host's single-instance Event (close_mutex.py) so a second client can start
  4. launch a second plain client (StarCraft.exe -launch, no bridge)
  5. guest: M,E,Down,O,Down,O -> same menus, but Down picks the SECOND account and Ok logs
     it in: STOP at the LAN games list

Closed loop: SC:R renders its menu ~5s before it reads input, so blindly timed keys drift (a
run landed O on the main menu's Options). Each key is posted, then watched — one that did not
change the screen is resent (arrows only move a highlight, so they get a soft check instead of
resends). Evidence for every step: build/auto_game/lan_park_{host,guest}_*.png (PrintWindow
capture, works while the windows are occluded — the keys are posted, the screen stays yours).

The host flow is the calibrated auto_game.py lan-create preset minus its final Ok (which would
create the game); the guest is lan-join's prefix with the account Down and minus its final Ok
(which would join the listed game). Finish by hand: pick map/race in the host dialog and Ok to
create; the game appears in the guest's games list — join it. Gary plays the HOST client (the
one with the bridge), so its lobby row must be Terran. Once the match runs:
