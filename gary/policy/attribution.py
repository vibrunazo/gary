"""Which inputs moved a learned decision: each group of what the deciding model saw zeroed in turn (as if
not there: no Terran army seen, no money, no history), the chosen option's odds again. The groups that
move them most go in the decision's record (gary/decision_log.py "why"), so that a record says what the
choice rested on, not only what was logged next to it (ARCHITECTURE section 8: counterfactual consistency
by construction). One batched forward pass a decision: a row per group.

Only groups whose absence is a state the player could be in are zeroed: what it saw of the enemy, its
money, its own history and plan. Its own units, supply and the time aren't: with no drones the model wants
a drone (43% -> 96%), true and useless, and such answers crowded out the reasons.

  macro  (gary/policy/macro.py):  minerals, gas, enemy army / workers / buildings in sight now and the most
         seen, its decision history, its build style
  army   (gary/policy/army.py):   the enemy on the map (army and workers in sight, buildings in sight and ever
         seen, army seen lately), enemy units in sight by type, enemy army remembered, money
