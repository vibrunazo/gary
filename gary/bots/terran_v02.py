"""Gary v0.2, Terran: what to make, and in what order, comes from the learned macro model.

The model (gary/policy/macro.py) was trained on ~14,000 pro TvZ games. Whenever Gary is free to
decide, it looks at Gary's state the way a player knows it (own units, resources, what has been
scouted, what Gary has made so far) and ranks every possible next production decision. Gary takes
the most likely one it can actually do now (requirements built, a building free to make it, a base
free to expand to), waits for the money, and carries it out with human hands: select the
building (hotkey or click), press the hotkey, or walk a worker over and place the building.

Still scripted, from v0.1: mining, sending three workers to each refinery, hotkeys and rallies,
and the army (attack-move with every 16 army units). Not yet: defense, scouting, micro.

    python -m gary.bots.terran_v02 --map path/to/map.scx --minutes 10
    python -m gary.bots.terran_v02 --live              # in a Remastered game, via the bridge
    python -m gary.bots.terran_v02 --map ... --style 1 # steer toward a build style (taxonomy cluster)
