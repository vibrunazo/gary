"""Roles (layer L4, docs/CONTROL.md): what each of Gary's fighting units does, every half second.

A role per unit, as eval/micro_roles.py labels the pros' marines: fire, close in, pull back,
retreat (stand: nothing to do). Decided by hand rules (provider `rules/v1`) or by the role model
learned from the pros' labels (`learned/v1`, gary/policy/roles.py); each role's skill picks where
to go from the threats around (their positions and weapon ranges, the walkable ground), and the
motor layer's command skill clicks it. One role group per turn (12 units at most), the most
urgent. The hand rules:

  retreat    the zerg near Gary's group outweigh it (supply, SCVs fighting with it counted) 2.5 to
             1: to safety. Into a bunker of Gary's with room, within 15 tiles (the nearest marines,
             as many as fit); else, away from home, away from them to the edge of their weapon
             range plus a margin. At home (a Command Center within 14 tiles) there is no walking
             away: the SCVs would be left to the zerg, so the army fights with them
  pull_back  units in contact with an attacker that targets them, under half HP, with other units
             near them firing: each steps 1.5 tiles away from its attackers (a walkable direction)
  fire       units with an enemy in range that aren't attacking: attack-move at the enemy group
  close_in   units with no enemy in range, when Gary's group isn't weaker there: attack-move toward
             the nearest enemy group
  brace      (an option) the zerg coming at the group (closer than half a second before): nobody
             closes in, let them come into the fire. What pros' marines do then: they stand and
             shift into place (17% of the time sideways), attack-moving at them half as much as
             v0.10, whose close in caused 72% of its marines' attack-moves while zerglings came.
             While none is within 7 tiles yet, units ahead of the pack (2+ tiles closer to the
             threat than its median) step back to it, and units attack-moving at it stop
  leash      (an option) at home, close in only on zerg that are near Gary's buildings (5 tiles) or
             attacking its units: the pros hold their base early, they don't hunt zerglings
             hovering outside it
  volley     (an option) close in by moving (not attack-moving: in BW the front marines stop to
             shoot one by one as they come in range, and the rest trickle in behind), to the edge
             of the marines' range from the nearest zerg; nobody of the group fires until 5 of it
             (or all, if fewer) are in range or one of it is attacked, then they fire together
  anchor     (an option) at home, the army stays by its anchors (Command Centers, bunkers): a unit
             farther than ANCHOR_OUT from all of them with zerg within ANCHOR_DANGER falls back to
             the nearest (moving: pulled out, not fighting its way); and the leash's prey are only
             the zerg by Gary's buildings, not those attacking a unit out there (in Gary's losses
             to Zerg v2's all-in, 41% of its army's deaths at 5:00-8:00 were out in the open, the
             units last told to fire or close in; the rest walked out after them)
  holds      (an option) units on hold position are left there by fire and close in (they shoot
             whatever comes in range): a pro's marines holding a gap in a wall or a choke stay in it
             (scenario 0c50ac60: the pro's 3 marines hold a gap against 17 zerglings for 45 s and
             live; v0.10 attack-moved them out at 5 s and lost them all)
  kite       (an option) vultures pull back from melee zerg (zerglings, ultralisks) within 2.5
             tiles at any HP, alone or not: hit and run (fire sends them back in). v0.10 attack-moved
             them into zergling packs like marines and lost 2.5x the pros' vulture value
  fire=      (an option) how fire fires: "enemy" (attack-move at the nearest enemy, as above: after
             each kill the units walk on toward where it was, off their spot), "here" (attack-move
             to the group's own middle: they shoot what comes in range and stay), or "hold" (hold
             position: they shoot what is in range, never chase). The pros' marines die on attack
             unit 52%, hold position 9%, a move 17%; v0.10's on attack unit 74%
  post       (an option) at home, the army holds a post by the Command Center, 3 tiles from it
             toward the zerg (or: "minerals", between it and its mineral line; "bunker", just behind
             the bunker by it nearest the zerg; "ramp", just inside the main's ramp, at the main): units with nothing in range more than 3 tiles from it go back to it
             (attack-moving), and only zerg attacking something of Gary's or standing by its
             buildings are closed in on (the leash). While zerg are 7-16 tiles from their marines
             at home, the pros' stand nearer the Command Center than v0.10's (within 6 tiles 46%
             of the time, v0.10's 37%), in bigger groups (7, v0.10's 5), and the standoff lasts:
             twice the marine-minutes of v0.10's, who close the distance
  vultures   (an option) vultures skirmish as a group, apart from the other roles (selected with a
             ctrl+click: every vulture on screen, no marines): any zerg within its reach + 2 tiles of
             a vulture, they move away 3.5 tiles (toward Gary's other fighters, not into a corner,
             not into the workers: the zerg follow);
             else, weapons ready and a zerg in range, they
             shoot the nearest; else, reloading with zerg near, they step away. They never close
             in. With zerg within 8 tiles the pros' vultures move 44% of the time, attack a unit
             33%, hold 8% (patrol 1%, mines rare this early), at 2.9 tiles/s; v0.10's attack 65%,
             move 7%, at 1.3 tiles/s, and lose twice as many (home defenses)
  gap_post   (an option, with post) where Gary's frontier (gary/walls.py) has a wall gap (an
             opening under 4 tiles that zerglings get through, with one of Gary's buildings a side
             of it) and the zerg are still outside the frontier, the post is just inside the gap
             nearest the zerg (ahead of closing in on zerg by Gary's buildings: they're at the wall), and units there hold position (fire and close in leave them on
             it). The pros' marines on hold stand at such an opening 23% of the hold time
  regroup    (an option) only the pack closes in: units with nothing in range that are away from
             the pack (the biggest bunch of Gary's fighters, linked within 4 tiles; a bunker and
             SCVs fighting count) rejoin it, attack-moving to its middle, instead of closing in
             alone. The pros' marines die among 3.8 friends (within 4 tiles), v0.10's among 2.5;
             48% of v0.10's die with at most one friend near, 29% of the pros'

Units another source holds by lease (a rule loading them into a bunker...) are left out.

With a decision log open (the fight layer's rl_log), each turn is recorded: the model's inputs
(the snapshot and the units' motion) and each of Gary's units' decision (its new role, or keep).
The hand rules' log is data to distill them into a model (ingest/role_distill.py); the learned
provider then draws roles from its probabilities instead of taking the likeliest, and its log is
what reinforcement learning trains on (train/roles_rl.py).
