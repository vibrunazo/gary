"""The attention arbiter (layer L6, docs/CONTROL.md): which layer gets Gary's hands next.

One task at a time on one pair of hands: when a task runs, the arbiter lets it go on; otherwise it
asks the layers in a fixed order and the first that wants the hands gets them (it sets the task).

  fixed_priority/v1  Gary v0.2-v0.9's order (each act):
                     1. the posture looks at the game
                     2. with a fight layer: production's turn after each fight command; then, every
                        half second, a fight turn (rules, then the model) that may interrupt cheap
                        chores (mining, gas, hotkeys)
                     3. the running task; finishing stalled buildings; idle workers to mining; the
                        idle-worker sweep; hotkeys for new buildings; gas
                     4. the army: the fight model first (units in a fight are its), then the army
                        layer with the rest (none of it if the posture keeps the army home)
                     5. macro
  fixed_priority/v2  v1, and a fight turn may also interrupt a build that is only waiting (its
                     worker walking to the base, or waiting for money with the worker selected):
                     the build is put aside and goes on when the fight leaves the hands free, the
                     same worker selected again. With v1 the fight waited for builds 43 times in
                     the 114 home defenses, up to 9.7 s
  drill/v1           micro drills (gary/drills.py): the fight layer, plus a chore and camera
                     interruptions so the fight doesn't get all of Gary's hands

The trace (Gary.trace, saved next to the POV log; python -m gary.agent.trace <file> sums it up):

  arbiter   a task started: who asked (granted_to: "macro", "army", "scout", "fight", "rule:pull",
            "executor:gas"...), the task, and the task a fight turn interrupted, if any
  task_end  a task ended: how long it held Gary's hands, whether it was interrupted
  wait      a layer wanted the hands while they were busy elsewhere, for 1 s or more: macro (a
            decision taken, not yet carried out) or the fight (one going on, the hands on a task
            the fight may not interrupt); with the tasks that held the hands meanwhile

Waits are read from what the layers already keep (the macro's goal, the fight's last snapshot):
the arbiter asks no layer more than it did before, so tracing changes nothing Gary does.
