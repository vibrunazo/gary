"""The macro executor (layer L2b, docs/CONTROL.md): how macro decisions get done with Gary's hands.

Building placement, workers (mining, gas, building), hotkeys and rallies for production buildings,
and selecting a building to train or research in. Scripted (provider `scripted/v1`, from Gary
v0.1-v0.2). It works on what the decision layers ask for (build tasks, commands) and on chores it
notices itself (idle workers, a refinery short of workers, a new building without a hotkey).

`Executor` here is the race-neutral part; a race plugs in its own over it (docs/REFACTOR.md):
gary/agent/terran_executor.py, gary/agent/zerg_executor.py.
