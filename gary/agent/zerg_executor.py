"""The Zerg executor (docs/REFACTOR.md Phase 1): Zerg hands over the race-neutral Executor, from
Gary-Z's (its gary_z.py and zerg_v3.py, in git before the refactor's Phase 3).

  produce   a larva's unit: a tiny box on a fresh larva (one just morphed still shows as a larva a
            moment: not again), then its key; zergling and scourge orders make two
  morph     a unit's or a building's morph (a Lurker from a Hydralisk; a Lair, a Hive, a Greater
            Spire, a sunken or spore from a creep colony): one of them selected, one with nothing
            of Gary's on top first, another after each miss (an overlord over the hydralisks took
            every click), then its key
  build     a drone's building, by the shared build task with the drone's order: it walks there and
            becomes the building (on creep, which the game's check asks); creep colonies in front of
            the natural once Gary holds it
  supply    an overlord ahead of production (option depots): supply left at most 2 per hatchery
  gas       the shared refill, but none while the gas floats (over GAS_FLOAT and over the minerals: its
            drones mine minerals until it is under GAS_LOW), unless a Spire stands and the first flock
            isn't made yet
  rallies   each hatchery beside its base's minerals while droning, the army's meeting point from
            RALLY_FRONT_AT, the main while the meeting point is besieged
