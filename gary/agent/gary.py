"""Gary: one choice of provider per layer (docs/CONTROL.md), and what the layers share.

The layers (posture, macro, executor, army, fight, arbiter) are objects that each get this Gary
and use the shared state through it: the human interface, the map, the one task Gary's hands are
on, the bookkeeping more than one layer reads (reservations, hotkeys, workers taken off mining).
What only one layer uses stays in that layer. A manifest (gary/agent/manifests.py) says which
provider fills each layer.
