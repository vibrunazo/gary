"""Army rules a manifest turns on (docs/REFACTOR.md Phase 2), from Gary-Z's army; none Zerg-specific in
kind (a Terran could raid with wraiths, press with tanks, post a floating building):

  posts   watchers (Zerg: overlords) on the posts outside the enemy's natural, toward the map's middle and
          halfway there, once its home is known; before, one to each start it may be at (its scouting).
          One lost is replaced after POST_AGAIN.
  raid    the harassment flyers (Zerg: mutalisks) as one flock on a hotkey: formed from RAID_FLOCK by a
          town hall; out along the map's edge to a post beyond the mineral line with no static anti-air
          seen by it and the least anti-air; its workers picked off one at a time; backed off when the
          flock bleeds or anti-air comes within reach, again after a rest, another line after
          RAID_CYCLES; home under RAID_KEEP of the flock; at home, it defends the town halls.
  join    a cluster under JOIN_BELOW of the main one's size walks to it (each drawing its own way, they
          fought apart: Gary-Z's fighters died with 15% of its army there, the pros' 27%)
  sweep   the main body attacks an enemy packet in sight that it outweighs (theirs under SWEEP_ODDS of its
          own supply) within SWEEP_FAR, away from static defense
  press   far ahead (its army PRESS_RATIO times the enemy fighters seen in PRESS_MEMORY, PRESS_MIN at
          least) and nothing at home, the main body attacks the enemy building it knows of that ends a game
          first, the nearest within each rank; re-aimed every PRESS_AGAIN
  lords   an enemy overlord in sight with no fighters or anti-air of the enemy near it, within LORD_REACH of
          a free shooter of Gary's (Terran: a marine not in a fight or a bunker): the nearest LORD_HUNTERS
          hunt it, held by the rule (the fight and the army leave them be), re-aimed every LORD_REAIM, until
          it dies, gets away (LORD_LOST) or LORD_FOR is up. A pro Terran kills an exposed overlord with one or
          two marines (a supply block for the Zerg); Gary-T's marines shot one a few times and wandered off
          with their group (the user, after human game 4)

Each records its decisions (gary/decision_log.py) and works with Gary's hands: posts and the raid by their
own selections and minimap orders, the cluster rules by an army order to the motor.
