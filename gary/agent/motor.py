"""The motor layer (L5, docs/CONTROL.md): skills that turn an intent into clicks over time.

"direct" (Gary v0.1-v0.9's way of carrying decisions out, provider `direct/v1`): one skill per
intent kind, each a task on Gary's hands:

  command      the fight model's commands (MOVE, ATTACK_MOVE, ATTACK_UNIT, GATHER, OWN_UNIT, STOP,
               HOLD, STIM, RETURN_CARGO), and the roles (FIRE, CLOSE_IN, PULL_BACK, RETREAT: roles.py
               picks the point): select the group (or keep the selection when it already is the
               group), camera on it if needed, then right-click / A-click / the key. "exact"
               (a body block, block.py): exactly those units, by clicks on each where the
               game's hit test finds it (not a drag box), waiting to see the selection before
               clicking again (any_scv: whichever mining SCVs the clicks take); "place": a
               right-click exactly on a spot (nudged only off another unit)
  PULL         camera on the base, drag-box the miners nearest the attackers, attack-move there
  UNPULL       drag-box the pulled workers, right-click minerals
  LOAD         drag-select the marines (camera on them if needed), camera on the bunker,
               right-click it
  REPAIR       camera on the bunker and the SCVs, drag-box them, (surround: right-click the ground
               past the bunker, then) right-click the bunker
  REINFORCE    camera on the new units, drag-box them, attack-move on the minimap
  ARMY_MOVE, ARMY_ATTACK   drag-box the cluster 12 at a time, order each box on the minimap
  SCOUT        pick a worker once and give it a hotkey; recall it, right-click on the minimap
  ATTACK_WAVE  gather the waiting army with drag boxes, attack-move on the minimap

Every order a skill gives takes its units' leases for the intent (intents.py).
